Knowing why it's important to log in
When you log in to your System Mechanic account, you may change your settings, activate your product, manage your subscription, and get the latest updates. It also links your iolo account to your software license, which makes it easy to reinstall or move the product later.

If you don't log in, you might only be able to use basic or trial capabilities, which limits the program's full potential. If you can log in successfully, the software will know your license and give you full access to premium products like ActiveCare, System Shield, and Privacy Guardian.

How to Set Up an iolo Account
You need an iolo account to be able to log in to System Mechanic. Here's how to make one if you haven't already:

Launch the System Mechanic program on your computer.

Click the "Sign In" or "Create Account" button on the welcome screen or dashboard.

You will be taken to the form to make an account, where you will need to fill out:

Your complete name

An email address that works

A password that is safe

Check your inbox and click on the verification page to validate your email after you enter your information.

Your iolo account is now ready to use, and you can log in to see the features you paid for.

Don't worry if you lost your login password. System Mechanic has an easy way to reset it:

Fixing problems with logging in
Most of the time, the login process goes well, but some users may have problems. Here are some ways to fix common problems:

Wrong email address or password? Check your credentials again. Keep in mind that the email and password are case-sensitive.

No Internet Connection: Your PC needs to be connected to the internet since you need to be online to log in.

Outdated Software Version: System Mechanic may not work with older versions of the software. Get the newest version from the official source.

Firewall or antivirus software may sometimes block access to your account. Turn them off for a short time and then try to log in again.

If none of these measures work, you can get help with account recovery by calling iolo customer service.

How to Keep Your Login Information Safe
To keep your account safe and avoid problems, it's crucial to keep your login information protected:

Make sure your password is strong and unique, and that it has letters, numbers, and special characters.

Don't let other people know your iolo account information.

You might want to use a password manager to keep your login information safe and fill it in automatically.

If you're using a computer that other people can use, always log out.
